This program models one of the strategies (called contiguous allocation) that an
operating system may use to manage the file system space. The general idea for our modeler is as follows: the storage device is a sequence of bytes that is partitioned by the OS into equal size blocks. A file, depending on its size, may be stored in one or more of these blocks. For example, if a block size is 4096 bytes and the file size is 5000 bytes, then the file will occupy 2 blocks: one block will be fully utilized, while the other will be underutilized, with only 904 bytes used. In our modeler, a block cannot be used for more than one file, so in this case we are dealing with internal fragmentation, i.e. underutilization of one specific block by 3192 bytes.
